Usage

To use the server, download version 1.21.3 from Purpur's own site and put it in the main folder. Starting Purpur's own JAR will prepare the server.
The server will create a eula.txt file, open this file with a text editor and set eula=true and then restart Purpur. Then it will download the necessary files.
